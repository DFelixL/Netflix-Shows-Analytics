This project focuses on analyzing Netflix show data to gain insights into content trends, audience preferences, and streaming patterns. Starting with raw CSV data, the project involves a series of steps to transform the data into actionable visualizations.

Steps Involved:
1. Data Understanding:
    Firstly, the raw data is examined to identify key attributes, such as titles, rating, release years, type, duration, etc. The structure, types of data, and potential relationships between attributes is also assessed to understand the scope of analysis.

2. Data Cleaning:
    Incomplete records are identified for missing or null values and then removed from the dataset to ensure data consistency. This process involves scanning the dataset for any gaps or missing entries, which may disrupt the accuracy and reliability of the analysis.
   
3. Data Preprocessing:
    Irrelevant columns are removed from the dataset to ensure a strong correlation between attributes. Additionally, the age of each movie is calculated to assess its popularity over its production lifetime.

4. Data Analysis & Visualization:
    Statistical methods and visualization tools is used to analyze patterns and trends over time. The visualization, such as bar chart and countplot, is displayed to highlight key insights.

Insight gathered :
- The distribution of movie is rising exponentially.
- In most countries, movies are more popular than TV shows.
- In the UK, the popularity of movies and TV shows is roughly the same
